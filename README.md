<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="Cyclisticlogo.png" alt="Example Image" width="300"/></div>

#### Scenario
In this project, I analyzed how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently to develop strategies for increasing annual memberships. The analysis aimed to uncover patterns in bike usage, understand key differences between membership types, and provide actionable insights for a targeted marketing strategy. I used R for data cleaning and analysis, and Tableau to create visualizations in a dashboard to support the findings. I created a report using R Markdown. Additionally, a version of the report created with Jupyter Notebook, which includes data analysis performed using Python, is also included in the project.

.

#### 1 - Key Objectives:

- Analyze Usage Patterns: Explore and compare the usage behavior of annual members versus casual riders.
- Identify Trends: Determine patterns in bike usage, including frequency, duration, and time of day.
- Develop Strategies: Formulate recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members based on data-driven insights. 
.

#### 2 - Methodology:

The project utilized data analysis techniques to clean, transform, and visualize the data. Key steps included:

- Data Cleaning: Addressed inconsistencies and missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted descriptive and statistical analyses to identify usage trends.
- Visualization: Created visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
- Reporting: Documented the analysis process and results to support strategic recommendations.

.

#### 3 - Outcome:

The findings provided a comprehensive understanding of bike usage patterns, highlighting opportunities for targeted marketing initiatives and membership growth. The project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and strategic planning.

#### 5 - Dashboard

For a more comprehensive analysis, I created a dashboard in Power BI [Click here to see it.](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNjJlNDQ1MGYtMjVmOS00NDY5LWI0NjEtNzc2ODZiM2I5OGNlIiwidCI6ImEyZTJiYTY0LWUwNTQtNDMxYS1hNWIyLTg5MjJmZjIyN2U3OSIsImMiOjR9)

Additionally, I created a dashboard in Tableau. [Click here to see it](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/francisco.navarro7243/viz/CiclysticBike-Share/Dashboard1).
